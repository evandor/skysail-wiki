Maybe you just read the introduction and don't really know how to proceed. Please check the next sections.

## Hello World

If you want to get a first idea of what this is all about, just download and run the simplest of all applications: A HelloWorldApplication, you can get it from [here](http://downloads.skysail.io/apps/helloworld/).

Once downloaded, start it from the command line like

```
java -jar skysail.app.helloworld.jar
```

Running this for the very first time will create a config folder \(as it was missing\), stop the framework and ask you to run it again.

Then open up [http://localhost:2023/hello/v1](http://localhost:2023/hello/v1) and post a new greeting.

If you wonder why you had to download more then 40MB for a simple HelloWorld Application \(or if you are curious\), please read this page giving you some more information about what this Application actually does.
