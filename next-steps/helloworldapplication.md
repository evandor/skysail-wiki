# HelloWorldApplication

So, you already ran the HelloWorldApplication like described [here](/next-steps.md)? And you wonder why this was more than 40MB big? In a programming language, a "HelloWorld" Application is usually very tiny. But skysail is not a programming language, it is a BaaS, a Backend-as-a-Service, and a minimal skysail application will not just print "hello world" - it is a ready-to-run server application, including an http server, an \(in-memory\) database, validation, configuration, user management, security mechanisms and more.
