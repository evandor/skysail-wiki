# Resources

Resources play a crucial role in REST. Restlet, being the framework skysail builds upon, defines a class "org.restlet.resource.ServerResource" which should be extended to implement server-side resources. skysail extends this class with "SkysailServerResource" and resources in skysail typically extend the latter class.
