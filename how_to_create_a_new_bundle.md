# How to... create a new bundle project

### Assumptions

This How-to assumes that you have set up eclipse with bndtools and checkout the set of skysail projects.

### Example

For this example, let's assume we want to create a new skysail application which is able to parse a directory structure for mp3 files, list them and let's the user play them.

### Creating the project

In eclipse, in the package explorer, right-click and choose *New* > *Bndtools OSGi Project*. Leave the defaults, name it *skysail.server.app.music*. On the next page, select *Empty Project* as Project Template. Click finish.
