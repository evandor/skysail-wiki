# Implementation Status

The very first page of this gitbook mentioned a couple of typical backend logic to be covered by skysail:

* **Authentication** / **Authorization**
* **Security** **aspects** \(like injections\)
* **Configuration**
* **Validation**
* **Documentation**
* **Persistence**
* **User Management**
* **HTML Rendering** \(Template Engine\) and - 
* **calling other APIs**

Click the various links to learn about the status of the current implementation of the associated feature\(s\).

Skysail is work-in-progress, so these pages should prepare you for what to expect from the current version. Aspects considered to be already implemented will be removed from this list.
