## git repositories

There's a lot of repositories @ [http://www.github.com/evandor](http://www.github.com/evandor). It took me a long time to decide what skysail should really be about - and I even switched programming languages. The only relevant repositories are:

skysail-core

skysail-server

skysail-ext

\(skysail-apps\)
